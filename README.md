# road-trip

EZ Plan (name changed after repository was created) is a one-stop app that allows the user to plan a night out in a specific city. The user can search by city and date to pull up a list of events that is generated from the TicketMaster API. The search also pulls up a list of restaurants in that same city through the Zomato API. 

The user can click on an event and see the details, including a link to purchase tickets through Ticketmaster. When the user clicks on a specific restaurant, the details are generated, including a link to the restaurant menu via Zomato. 

The user's search is saved through Local Storage, so when they return to the page their information is still available.
